  Datacleaning1.ipynb      # Jupyter notebook for data cleaning
outputs/
  cleaned_*.csv            # Output files after processing
scripts/                   # (Reserved for Python scripts)
```

## Data Sources
- `olist_customers_dataset.csv`
- `olist_geolocation_dataset.csv`

## How to Use
1. **Data Cleaning:**
   - Open `notebooks/Datacleaning1.ipynb` in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
   - Run the cells to clean and preprocess the raw data.
   - Cleaned data will be saved in `data/cleaned_data/` and `outputs/`.

2. **Analysis:**
   - Use the cleaned datasets for further analysis, visualization, or modeling.

## Requirements
- Python 3.8+
- Jupyter Notebook
- pandas, numpy, matplotlib, seaborn (install via `pip install -r requirements.txt` if available)

## Outputs
- Cleaned CSV files in `outputs/` and `data/cleaned_data/`.
- Graphs and charts generated from the analysis are saved in the `outputs/` folder.
